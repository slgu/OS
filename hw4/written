we test our schduler by the score for Geekbench

under front weight 10 back weight 1:
	single-core: 558
	multi-core: 1839

under front weight 5 back weight 1:
	single-core: 535
	multi-core: 1752

under front weight 1 back weight 1:
	single-core: 567
	multi-core: 1947

default scheduler:
	single-core: 577
	multi-core: 1774

There is no qualitative difference, just some noisy change.

Using the benchmark along with 378 system call we can see wrr_weight of differen cpu and find the weight is almost balanced.

Apart from the Geekbench test, test by test3.c program (which is high cpu computation tasks, fork 40 children processes, doing some
cpu computation, sleep, doing some computation and return). This test needs to set our scheduler class behind fair or other programs will get
stucked and android will reboot (by get wrr info, we find in this test.3 program, wrr_weight is almost balanced too proving the corretness of our load
balance (and we use trace_printk to see if the load balance is working too).
